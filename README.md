# Weather at the equator

#### How does the weather change as we get closer to the equator? Data was collected from the OpenWeatherMap API and manipulated using python and pandas. Visualization were created for temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed of 700 randomly chosen countries around the world to determine the weather patterns around the equator.

#### Challenge
-  Understand API documentation and use API calls to gathered required data from openweathermap.
-Data cleaning and manipulation using pandas

- Dependencies :
    * numpy, pandas, matplotlib, requests, json, random
